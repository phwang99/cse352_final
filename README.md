First, download the up to date code from the master branch.
Next, run TrainSnake.py in order to train the Snake. It will output a trainedSnake.pth file which is generated everytime the the AI gets a highscore in its training session. One is included but will be overwritten on run.
To test how the trained file, trainedSnake.pth performs, run TestSnake.py to see how the snake performs with already trained model.
